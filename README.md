# pricer

Pricer analyzes a log file, which consists of buy and sell orders placed
in a stock market. Pricer takes two command-line arguments. The first is target-size,
which tracks the profit or loss which would be made if "target-size" shares were bought
or sold. The second is an optional filename to check Pricers
output against a known good output log file.
